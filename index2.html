        The hull of a ship is its main body, including the bottom, sides, and deck. It provides buoyancy and stability to the vessel, allowing it to float and navigate through water. The hull is typically made of wood, metal, or fiberglass, and its design can vary depending on the type of ship and its intended use.

        <h2>Anchor</h2>
        <p>An anchor is a heavy device, typically made of metal, that is used to secure a ship or boat to the seabed. It is designed to dig into the bottom surface, providing stability and preventing the vessel from drifting due to wind or currents. Anchors come in various shapes and sizes, each suited for different types of seabeds and vessel sizes.</p>
